Creating a cartoon-like caricature out of portrait image.
Take a photo of your friends or celebrities and have a laugh on funny results this program produces!

The goal of the project was to create automated caricature generator. To accomplish this, first, I used feature detection to identify important face features and magnified them to highlight personâ€™s characteristics. Second, I used number of filters and image manipulations to create a pencil-drawing feel to the image.
Versatile abilities of OpenCV library motivated me to take as much advantage of it as possible and combine two main features of the library - feature detection and pixel manipulation.

To use:\n
1) Put images into images/source/\n
2) run 'python final_test.py'\n
3) The output results are placed into images/output
